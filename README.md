Website for [https://angular.io/](https://angular.io/)

# How to build this site?

Follow [Angular.io's development setup](https://github.com/angular/angular.io#development-setup) and [Local server with watches and browser reload](https://github.com/arliang/angular.io/tree/make-google-api-local#local-server-with-watches-and-browser-reload)

After all steps above, run `npm run harp compile`,  you'll get a `www` directory, that's the code for this repository.

I made google resources local in this repository. You can get it [here](https://github.com/arliang/angular.io/tree/make-google-api-local)
